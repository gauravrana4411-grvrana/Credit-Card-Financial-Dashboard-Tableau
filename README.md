# Credit Card Financial Analysis Dashboard – Tableau

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer spending, income utilization, and payment behaviors across different demographic segments. The goal is to provide actionable insights that support credit risk assessment, marketing strategies, and business decision-making. The dashboard is built in Tableau and designed to be intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.

## Objectives
- Understand customer spending patterns by age, occupation, gender, and city.
- Analyze income versus spending relationships to assess credit utilization.
- Identify preferred payment methods and trends across demographic segments.
- Highlight potential credit risk indicators and actionable business insights.

## Data Sources
- Customer demographics (age, gender, occupation, marital status, city)
- Income details
- Monthly spending values
- Payment methods (credit card, debit card, UPI, net banking)

*All sensitive or personal information has been anonymized.*

## Data Preparation
- Standardized field names and data types for consistency.
- Categorized demographic variables (age group, occupation, gender, marital status).
- Handled missing or inconsistent values to ensure accuracy.
- Validated numeric fields such as income and spending for correctness.

## Dashboard Features
- **Global Filters:** Segment data by age, occupation, gender, marital status, and city.
- **High-Level KPIs:** Total customers, average monthly income, average monthly spend, and income utilization percentage.
- **Spending Analysis:** Bar charts and scatter plots showing spend distribution by age, occupation, and city.
- **Payment Behavior:** Visualizations of payment method usage by age group and customer segments.
- **Credit Risk Indicators:** Insights based on spending patterns, income utilization, and payment behavior.

## Key Insights
- Customers generally use less than half of their income for monthly spending, indicating responsible credit usage.
- Highest spending groups: salaried IT employees and mid-career customers aged 35–45.
- Metro cities contribute more significantly to total spending.
- Payment preferences vary by age, with younger customers favoring UPI and older customers relying on credit cards.
- Overall credit risk is low; targeted monitoring can focus on younger segments and high-growth customers.

## Recommendations
- Consider increasing credit limits for high-income and high-spending segments.
- Target premium credit products in metro cities.
- Encourage younger customers using UPI to transition gradually to credit products via controlled offers.
- Personalize engagement strategies based on occupation, life stage, and spending behavior.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau:** Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations.
- **Excel / CSV:** Data import and cleaning.
- **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics and visual exploration.

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of customer behavior, enabling informed decisions for credit management, marketing, and risk mitigation. The interactive design allows stakeholders to explore insights seamlessly, bridging data with actionable business strategies.
