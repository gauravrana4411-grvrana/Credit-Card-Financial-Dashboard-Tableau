# Credit-Card-Financial-Dashboard-Tableau
This dashboard focuses on understanding how customers spend across different demographic segments, how their spending relates to income, what payment behaviors they follow, and whether these behaviors signal any potential credit risk.

Project Objective and Business Context
Mitron Bank wanted a clear view of customer behavior to answer four main questions.
First, how is customer spending distributed across different segments such as age, occupation, gender, and city?
Second, how does actual spending compare to income, which helps assess credit utilization and future limit expansion?
Third, what payment patterns exist across age groups and payment types?
And finally, are there any early indicators of credit risk based on spending intensity and usage patterns?
The dashboard was designed to support business teams, credit managers, and leadership with a single, easy-to-use analytical view.

Data Preparation and Integrity
Before building any visuals, the focus was on data quality.
The data was imported into Tableau from CSV files containing customer demographics, income details, spending values, and payment methods.
All fields were standardized to ensure consistency. Demographic columns such as age group, occupation, gender, and marital status were clearly categorized. Numeric fields like income and monthly spend were formatted correctly and validated for accuracy. Missing or inconsistent values were handled so that they would not distort the analysis.
This preparation ensured that the data was accurate, well-structured, and ready for analysis, which is critical for decision-making.

Dashboard Design and Navigation
The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, even for non-technical users.
At the top, global filters allow users to quickly segment the data by age group, occupation, gender, marital status, and city. These filters apply across all visuals, enabling seamless cross-analysis.
The layout follows a logical storytelling flow. It starts with high-level KPIs that summarize overall customer behavior and then gradually moves into deeper segment-level insights.
This design allows users to answer both strategic and operational questions without needing multiple dashboards.

High-Level KPIs and Overall Insights
At the top of the dashboard, key metrics provide a snapshot of customer behavior.
We see the total number of customers, the average monthly income, the average monthly spend, and the income utilization percentage.
One important insight here is that customers are, on average, using less than half of their income on monthly spending. This indicates healthy credit behavior and suggests there is room for credit limit expansion for the right customer segments.
These KPIs immediately set the context for deeper analysis.

Spending Distribution by Occupation and Age Group
When we analyze spending by occupation, salaried IT employees emerge as the highest spending group, followed by business owners. Government employees and freelancers show relatively more conservative spending patterns.
From an age perspective, customers in the 35 to 45 age group demonstrate the highest average spending. This group is typically financially stable, has consistent income, and represents a strong target segment for premium credit products.
Younger customers, particularly those aged 21 to 24, show lower spending, which is expected but also indicates future growth potential.

City-Level and Demographic Insights
The city-level analysis shows that metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi NCR, and Bengaluru contribute significantly more to total spending compared to other cities.
This insight helps the bank prioritize geographic regions for premium offerings, targeted campaigns, and branch-level strategies.
Gender and marital status analysis further adds depth. Male customers account for slightly higher overall spending, while female customers show stable and consistent usage. Married customers tend to spend more than single customers, which aligns with higher household expenses and often indicates predictable financial behavior.

Income vs Spending Relationship
One of the most important visuals in the dashboard is the income versus spending scatter plot.
This chart clearly shows a positive relationship between income and spending. As income increases, spending also increases, but in a controlled and proportional manner. There are no significant clusters of customers who have low income but extremely high spending.
This pattern indicates that most customers are managing their credit responsibly, and there are no immediate red flags related to over-utilization.

Payment Behavior and Credit Usage Patterns
The payment type analysis reveals that credit cards dominate customer spending, followed by UPI and debit cards. Net banking is used less frequently for monthly spending.
When we break this down by age group, younger customers show a stronger preference for UPI, while older customers rely more heavily on credit cards. This shift in payment behavior is important for understanding how customers may transition into higher credit usage over time.
From a credit perspective, actual spending aligns well with income levels, indicating that current credit limits are largely appropriate.

Credit Risk Indicators
Based on spending consistency, income utilization, and payment patterns, the overall credit risk across the customer base appears low.
There are no strong indicators of excessive utilization or unstable spending behavior. Married and mid-career customers show predictable usage, while younger segments can be monitored as their spending grows.
This insight allows the bank to focus risk monitoring on specific transition segments rather than the entire customer base.

Actionable Business Recommendations
Based on the insights from the dashboard, several actionable recommendations emerge.
The bank can consider increasing credit limits for high-income and high-spending segments such as salaried IT employees and customers aged 35 to 45.
Premium credit card offerings can be targeted toward metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi NCR.
Younger customers who primarily use UPI can be gradually encouraged toward credit products through controlled offers and rewards.
Finally, customer engagement strategies can be personalized based on occupation, life stage, and spending behavior.
These recommendations are directly linked to the data and support both growth and risk management objectives.
